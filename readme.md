# Album of the Year List Project Visualizations

Migrates data from a Google Spreadsheet into a Drupal instance that serves as an API for a React app. Hopfully provides a fun way to experiment with the awesome Album of the Year List Project data and discover new music.

Visualizations based on data from http://robmitchum.github.io/aotysheets.html

The talk 'Hot JAMS(tack): Building a Music Discovery App with Drupal and React' has been presented at:
* MidCamp Chicago - March 10, 2018

Todo:
* Hope to provide additional instructions for running local instances of this project.  In the meantime changing to the react-app directory and running `npm install` followed by `npm start` will give you an instance of the react app that you can experiment with on your local host.
